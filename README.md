# PSA: Changes are happening

From August 2018 onwards, Linuxserver are in the midst of switching to a new CI platform which will enable us to build and release multiple architectures under a single repo. To this end, existing images for `arm64` and `armhf` builds are being deprecated. They are replaced by a manifest file in each container which automatically pulls the correct image for your architecture. You'll also be able to pull based on a specific architecture tag.

TLDR: Multi-arch support is changing from multiple repos to one repo per container image.

[Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) (formerly NZBdrone) is a PVR for usenet and bittorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

## Supported Architectures

Our images support multiple architectures such as `x86-64`, `arm64` and `armhf`. We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list). 

Simply pulling `linuxserver/sonarr` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Tag |
| :----: | --- |
| x86-64 | amd64-latest |
| arm64 | arm64v8-latest |
| armhf | arm32v6-latest |


## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker

```
docker create \
  --name=sonarr \
  -e PUID=1001 \
  -e PGID=1001 \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -p 8989:8989 \
  -v <path to data>:/config \
  -v <path/to/tvseries>:/tv \
  -v <path/to/downloadclient-downloads>:/downloads \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  linuxserver/sonarr
```

### Version Tags

This image provides various versions that are available via tags. `latest` tag usually provides the latest stable version. Others are considered under development and caution must be exercised when using them.

| Tag | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| latest | stable builds from the master branch of sonarr (currently v2) |
| develop | development builds from the develop branch of sonarr (currently v2) |
| preview | preview builds from the phantom-develop branch of sonarr (currently v3) |


### docker-compose

Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas.

```
---
version: "2"
services:
  sonarr:
    image: linuxserver/sonarr
    container_name: sonarr
    environment:
      - PUID=1001
      - PGID=1001
      - TZ=Europe/London
    volumes:
      - <path to data>:/config
      - <path/to/tvseries>:/tv
      - <path/to/downloadclient-downloads>:/downloads
    ports:
      - 8989:8989
    mem_limit: 4096m
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 8989` | The port for the Sonarr webinterface |
| `-e PUID=1001` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1001` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London, this is required for Sonarr |
| `-v /config` | Database and sonarr configs |
| `-v /tv` | Location of TV library on disk |
| `-v /downloads` | Location of download managers output directory |

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id username
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```
